# LearningFoodPreferences

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that each implement a separate method for preprocessing food log entry names. These notebooks are in the folder "methods_notebooks." It also contains necessary data files in the folder named "data." Running each notebook from start to finish will load a sample food log (which is found in the folder "sample_food_logs", run the food preference elicitation algorithm, and generate evaluation metrics. 

The required packages are nltk, pandas, os, numpy, gensim.models, sklearn, collections, and math.

The file containing the word embeddings is too large to upload. Please access and download it from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EoNIIfAhXgMaWgmrCOQkzqV2pOvKQOBN/view?usp=sharing.
