# LearningFoodPreferences

This repository contains Python notebooks that each implement a separate method for preprocessing food log entry names. It also contains necessary data files. Running each notebook from start to finish will load a sample food log, run the food preference elicitation algorithm, and generate evaluation metrics. 

The required packages are nltk, pandas, os, numpy, gensim.models, sklearn, collections, and math.
