# LearningFoodPreferences

This repository contains Python notebooks that each implement a separate method for preprocessing food log entry names. It also contains necessary data files. Running each notebook from start to finish will load a sample food log, run the food preference elicitation algorithm, and generate evaluation metrics. 

The required packages are nltk, pandas, os, numpy, gensim.models, sklearn, collections, and math.

The file containing the word embeddings is too large to upload. Please access and download it from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EoNIIfAhXgMaWgmrCOQkzqV2pOvKQOBN/view?usp=sharing.
